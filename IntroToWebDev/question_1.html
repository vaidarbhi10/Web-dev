<h1>Question 1</h1>
<h3>Explain the difference between frontend, backend, and full-stack development with suitable real-world examples.</h3>
<p>Frontend focuses on UI (HTML, CSS, JS), backend handles data and logic (Node.js, Python), full-stack does both. Example: Amazon website — frontend is the product page, backend manages cart and orders.</p>
